      There are plenty of AI checklists and maturity models. Most are sprawling,
      inconsistent, or buried in spreadsheets.
    </p>
    <p class="emphasis">
      AICO keeps the assessment tight, the scoring consistent, and the results easy to share.

      Assess once, compare across the portfolio, and revisit with confidence.
      Your operators see where to focus, and your partners get a clean summary.
    </p>
    <p>
      No decks full of caveats. No arguing over definitions. Just signal.
